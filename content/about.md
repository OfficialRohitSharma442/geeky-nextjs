## ⭐ **My Story: From Survival to Strength**

My journey into food hasn’t been ordinary.

In my bestselling memoir, **“The Queen of Linens,”** I share my deeply personal story — a life that began in extraordinary luxury and took a heartbreaking turn when I survived domestic violence that left me hospitalized for four days.

I lost nearly everything.  
I had to rebuild my life from scratch with my children.

And in that rebuilding, I rediscovered something that saved me:  
**cooking.**

Food became my therapy, my outlet, and my path back to myself.  
It gave me purpose, comfort, and the strength to start again.

- Instagram  
- TikTok
