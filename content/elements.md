### Paragraph

Hey there, I’m **John Miller** 👋 — welcome to *The Flavor Journal*!  
Here, I share recipes that make home cooking simple, flavorful, and fun. Whether it’s a weeknight pasta, a cozy soup, or a lazy Sunday breakfast, I believe great food doesn’t have to be complicated.

Food, for me, is about connection — to people, places, and stories. Every recipe on this blog comes from a memory, a craving, or a road trip somewhere delicious. So grab a spatula, pour yourself a cup of coffee, and let’s cook something amazing together.

### Emphasis

1. My favorite recipes are made with **simple ingredients** and a lot of love.  
2. Every meal deserves a little <ins>extra flavor</ins>.  
3. _Cooking is therapy — and sharing food is joy._  
4. The secret to great cooking is **balance**, not perfection.  
5. Baking is where patience meets creativity.  
6. Try to cook with what’s in season — it’s fresher and better for the planet.
