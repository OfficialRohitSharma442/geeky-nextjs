Smoothies are a versatile and healthy way to enjoy fruits, vegetables, and superfoods. They can be customized to fit any taste or nutritional goal.  

From creamy chocolate banana blends to refreshing green smoothies, experimenting with flavors is half the fun. Smoothies are perfect for breakfast, snacks, or even dessert.  

## Ingredients for Smoothies

- Fresh or frozen fruits (bananas, berries, mango)  
- Vegetables (spinach, kale, cucumber)  
- Liquid base (milk, yogurt, juice, or plant-based milk)  
- Optional add-ins (nuts, seeds, protein powder, honey)  

> Tip: Freeze fruits ahead of time for a thicker, colder smoothie without needing ice.
