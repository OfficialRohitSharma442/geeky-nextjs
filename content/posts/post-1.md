Making homemade pasta is easier than you think! With simple ingredients and a little patience, you can enjoy fresh, flavorful pasta at home. Perfect for a cozy dinner or impressing guests.  

Cooking at home not only gives you control over ingredients but also allows you to experiment with flavors and textures. Homemade pasta has a richer taste and better texture compared to store-bought versions.  

## Ingredients Needed

- 2 cups all-purpose flour  
- 3 large eggs  
- 1 tsp salt  
- 1 tbsp olive oil  

> Tip: Use a fork to lightly whisk the eggs before combining with flour. This helps achieve a smooth dough.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. On a clean surface, make a mound of flour and create a well in the center.  
2. Pour the eggs into the well and slowly mix with flour.  
3. Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes until smooth.  
4. Let it rest for 30 minutes, then roll and cut into your favorite pasta shapes.  
5. Cook in boiling salted water for 2-3 minutes until al dente.
