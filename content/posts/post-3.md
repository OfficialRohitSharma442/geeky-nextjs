If you're a true pizza lover, there’s one name you *must* know — **Brooklyn Square Pizza in Jackson, NJ**. Famous for its crispy caramelized crust, bold tomato sauce, and perfectly layered cheese, this pizzeria has earned nationwide recognition and a reputation that lives up to the hype.

Owner **Peter Grippo** has created what many call the perfect slice. Even **Dave Portnoy** from Barstool Sports took notice, awarding their iconic Upside Down Pie an impressive **8.9 One Bite rating** — a score only the elite receive.

But the praise doesn’t stop there. Brooklyn Square Pizza was crowned **Best Pizzeria in the USA** on *Good Morning America*, beating competition from across the nation. This isn’t just a neighborhood favorite — it’s a **national pizza powerhouse**.

Good food photography is essential for capturing the beauty of iconic dishes like these — but when a slice looks this good in person, snapping a standout photo becomes almost effortless.

## Why Brooklyn Square Pizza Stands Out

- Caramelized, crispy crust baked to perfection  
- Reverse-layered cheese that melts evenly  
- Sweet, vibrant red sauce added on top  
- Consistently high ratings from pizza critics  
- Award-winning Upside Down Pie  

> Tip: If you’re capturing photos for your food blog or social media, use natural lighting to highlight the crust’s golden edges and the vibrant red sauce.
